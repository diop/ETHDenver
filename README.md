# ETHDenver
Hackathon repository for ethdenver

Welcome

This repo is inteded to handle the submissions for 2 of the upcoming ETHDenver bounties.

Because we want to teach and encourage the same open source principles that underpin blockchains and decentralized networks more generally, we have decided to adopt an approach where each team will create their own branch from an issue to submit to the competition.

This achieves two primary aims. First, it ensures that all work done during the hackathon remains open source, like all the best code there is. Secondly, it introduces participants and other developers to GitHub and the open source community more generally and equips them with the skills to use resources like this for all future projects, whether they be specifically within the blockchain space, or outside it in the wider programming, FOSS community.

This is not to say that participants and other developers cannot take what they build in the hackathon, extend it and sell it onwards in a more proprietary fashion - all IP remains with the people who write the actual code. It's just our gentle way of encouraging people just entering the industry to adopt the best practices around how they work on and share their software.

Please check out our Open Issues in this repository to work on a project with Status for the ETHDenver hackathon and come by our booth if you have any other questions! 

Please note: We also have 2 more bounties in this hackathon located in our go-status fork, they have the `ETHDenver` Label!
